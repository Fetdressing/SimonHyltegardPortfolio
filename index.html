   <h2>Background</h2>
		I come from a background of both programming and art, with a general interest of working close to graphics and game feel. 
		At Blekinge Institute of Technology I studied for 3 years as a TA where we mainly worked with C++, DirectX and Autodesk Maya. We worked with the many different aspects of building a game, from modelling, rigging and writing HLSL to creating our own 3D-formats and building game engines.
		
		<br><br>I ran the game company Loophole Interactive together with 6 other very passionate people for roughly a year. During that time I also worked part time as a measurement engineer at Nolato Meditech during weekends, which definetely was a very stressful period but also one of the best moments of my life. <br>I worked as Lead Artist and did everything from building environments to character design, including things such as rigging, animation and effects.<br>We released the PC game <i>King of The Couch: Zoovival</i> and also went to San Francisco to pitch a game demo called <i>BossForge</i> for potential investors.
		
		<br><br>Worked two years as a TA at Attractive Interactive, with a main focus on UI and frontend. We worked on the mobile game <i>Paper Game</i> which had a unique premise of taking a photo and building a level out of that photo. <br>The game came with a lot of challenges, especially UI-wise as I had to develop an interface which allowed for users to quickly and intuitively build their own cool levels.<br>I worked close to the designer and artist, helping them realize their vision of the game. Creating tools for building UI and onboarding and trying as best as possible to not limit their creativity. <br>As part of a small development team I also delved into other areas of development, working with things like rigging, automated PR tests, shader building and gameplay logic.
		
		<br><br>Overall I love developing products that provides a friction-less and pleasant experience for the user, and I feel that I have the biggest impact on that when working close to graphics or user-experience.
