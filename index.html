<h1>Simon Hylteg√•rd</h1>
<p>Technical Artist focus on front-end development with 8 years experience in Unity3D and an early starting career using <b>Warcraft3</b>'s World Editor. <br>A strong desire to get started creating games after school lead to running a game company under Blekinge Business Incubator, with one released game. <br>A background working in newly started companies and small teams has made me delve and take interests in many different areas of development, <br>striving when I can learn new things and keep several balls in the air. </p>
